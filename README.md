# KeyValueStoreService

A Key-value Store is a service that enables a user to store a value linked to a key and it should also
provide ways to retrieve that value using the key and also delete the value.

A Persistent store is something that retains its state across restarts.

So, here you will have to create a service that exposes REST Apiâ€™s to create, read, update and delete a key-value pair. 
This service should be fast(Any key-value store should be fast.) and should retain back the state when restarted.

Key can be any STRING and value can be arbitrary JSON.

File storage is used for persisting
